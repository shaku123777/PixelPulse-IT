<p><h2>North America Pet Intestinal Medicine Market Drivers and Trends</h2><p>The growing awareness of pet health and the increasing number of pet owners in North America are significant drivers of the pet intestinal medicine market. As pet owners become more knowledgeable about their pets' digestive health, there is a rising demand for medications that address gastrointestinal issues such as diarrhea, constipation, and inflammatory bowel disease. Additionally, the shift towards more natural and organic pet care products is influencing the market, with consumers seeking safer, more sustainable solutions for their pets' digestive problems. This trend is further supported by advancements in veterinary care and the expansion of pet insurance coverage.</p><p>Another key trend shaping the North American pet intestinal medicine market is the increasing availability of over-the-counter (OTC) medications.
